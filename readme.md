## Introduction
The Saga SDK provides a list of common features that developers can use to interact with the Saga Platform using the SagaOS chainlet stack.

Currently, the Saga SDK makes features such as Access Control List (ACL) and Fee Distribution available. 

Using the ACL functions, you can add addresses that are allowed to perform admin and non-admin functions in interacting with a SagaOS chainlet.

Using the fee distribution function, you can transfer fees collected by the chainlet to certain recipient accounts.
